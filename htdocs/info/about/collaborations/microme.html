<a href="http://www.microme.eu" target="_blank">Microme</a> is a resource for bacterial metabolism, 
whose aim is to support the large scale inference of metabolic flux directly from genome sequence. 
It is populated with data generated by direct import from external sources and by automatic inference 
from these seed data onto additional genomes; data is subject to quality assurance (i.e. for chemical 
balance, consistency of cross-references and ultimately for their ability to define a viable model 
mathematically and their consistency with experimental evidence), and revised manually as appropriate.</p>

<p>Microme also provides an infrastructure for the integration of a curated repository of reference 
pathways and reactions, genome-scale constraint-based models, and downstream applications in comparative 
genomics and biotechnology.</p>

<h2>Microme and Ensembl Bacteria</h2>

<p>Microme data is integrated into the Ensembl Bacteria dataset through the inclusion of data from its 
pathway-reaction data matrix. Pathway data is generated from information provided by 
<a href="http://ecocyc.org/" target="_blank">EcoCyc</a> 
and <a href="http://metacyc.org/" target="_blank">MetaCyc</a>. The reactions in those pathways are 
correlated with reaction information from the 
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rhea/" target="_blank">Rhea reaction</a> database, and associated with 
reaction catalysts from the <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/" target="_blank">UniProt Knowledgebase</a>.</p>

<p>Since each of these UniProtKB proteins also corresponds to a translation in the Ensembl Bacteria 
dataset, this allows the source references from Rhea, MetaCyc, and other sources to be added to the 
"External references" detail of the corresponding transcripts. For example, see the Rhea and MetaCyc 
identifiers listed for <a href="/escherichia_coli_str_k_12_substr_mg1655/Transcript/Similarity?db=core;g=b2542;r=Chromosome:2670069-2671271;t=AAC75595">hcaD-1 on E. coli K-12</a>.</p>

<p>The Microme reaction matrix is rebuilt in tandem with the Ensembl Bacteria 
<a href="info/about/release_cycle.html">release cycle</a>, allowing for updated cross references to be 
added to each new release.</p>
