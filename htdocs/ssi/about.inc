<h2 class="first">Ensembl Bacteria</h2>
<p>Over 6000 genome sequences from bacteria and archaea have been annotated and deposited in the public archives of the members of the <a href="http://www.insdc.org/">International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration</a>.    This site provides access to complete, annotated genomes from bacteria and archaea (present in the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena">European Nucleotide Archive</a>) through the Ensembl graphical user interface (genome browser).  More details about the integration are provided <a href="/info/building/building_ensembl_bacteria.html">here</a></p>
<p>Programmatic access is available through the Ensembl Perl and REST-ful APIs and through publicly accessible mysql databases, along with full data dumps (including DNA sequence and protein sequence in FASTA format, annotations in GTF format, and mysql dump files).    Due to the large number of these databases, there is some modification to the APIs, and database and FTP site structure, compared to that used for other branches of the taxonomy (e.g. the storage of many genomes in one database; the provision of lookup services to identify genomes by INSDC identifiers, taxonomy identifiers, or partial names.    <a href="/info/data/accessing_ensembl_bacteria.html">Full details are available here</a>.</p>
<p>BioMart access is not available, but we are working on providing new, more powerful data mining tools to allow users to exploit these genomes. A selection of over 100 key bacterial genomes has been included in the pan-taxonomic Compara, and genes from all genomes are classified into families using HAMAP and PANTHER (<a href="/info/docs/compara/index.html">more details</a>)</p>
